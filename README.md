# GildedRose

Gilded Rose is a software application that is used to manage the quality of items in a player's inventory in a fantasy video game. It includes a set of rules for how the quality of each item changes over time, depending on various factors such as the item's sell-in value (how many days it has left until it can no longer be sold) and the item's quality value (a measure of how valuable the item is to the player). The Gilded Rose application allows players to view and update the quality of their items, and to sell or discard items as needed. The rules for how the quality of an item changes over time can be complex, and the Gilded Rose application helps players keep track of these changes and make informed decisions about their inventory management.
